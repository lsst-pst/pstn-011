The instrument for the Vera Rubin Observatory (previously known as LSST) comprises a modular array of CCDs. The main imaging array contains 3.17 Gpix spanning 9.6 square degrees that is sampled at 0.2 arcsec/pixel. The imaging array is implemented as a modular assembly of 21 independent ``science rafts'', each containing a 3 $\times$ 3 mosaic of 
4096 $\times$ 4096 pixel deep-depletion CCDs.  The four corners of the camera contain ``corner rafts'' that contain a 4096 $\times$ 4096 pixel guide sensors and a pair of 
2048 $\times$ 4096 pixel wavefront sensors that are positioned on either side of focus to obtain wavefront information. Each CCD has 16 output amplifiers. Subregions of the guiders are read out at a frame rate of 10 Hz while the shutter is open. The wavefront and science raft CCDs contain a total of 3088 channels that are read out in parallel, allowing the entire camera to be digitized in 2 seconds while meeting the read noise requirements of the system. The camera electronics reside within the vacuum system, and include a custom integrated circuit that performs correlated double sampling, providing signals to a bank of 18 bit high-precision analog to digital converters. The $f$/1.2 beam places stringent requirements on the planarity and flatness of the imaging array. This paper describes the design and implementation of the VRO camera, and initial performance characteristics.
